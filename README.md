# ATIKAHHHPERCA
HOLA! This is my first Project use Golang. 
Project's Name is ATIKAH PERCA. Honestly this is my new repository for this project cause my first repository so bad and dirty (i dont like it, confused).
So that's why i choose to make one new.

ATIKAH PERCA is an application/website to show and how to make perca can re-use. 
There are 8 entities from this project.
1. Admin is menu for someone who controll anything to update in web/apps.
2. HousePerca is menu for show place to recycle perca to make it be valueable
3. InfoHouse is menu for show u about House Perca training to make perca be valuable
4. JenisPerca is menu for show u perca type
5. PekerjaPerca is menu for show u workers data in house perca
6. PercaBaju is menu for show u clothes from recycle perca
7. PercaSepatu is menu for show u shoes from recycle perca
8. TutorialPerca is menu for show u how to recycle perca per step, tools and materials

I think i want to add user later, so another people can use this app to. wish me luck.
